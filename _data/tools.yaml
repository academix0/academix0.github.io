  description: The BioThings suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) focuses on data integration for key biomedical entities, including genes ([mygene.info](https://mygene.info)), variants ([myvariant.info](https://myvariant.info)), and chemicals ([mychem.info](https://mychem.info)), which are collectively accessed millions of times per month. We also provide a [software development kit (SDK)](https://docs.biothings.io/en/latest/) for easily creating custom APIs, including those served at [biothings.transltr.io](https://biothings.transltr.io).

  description: BioThings Explorer (BTE) leverages the semantically-precise annotations of APIs in the SmartAPI registry to create a federated knowledge graph. BTE can autonomously execute multi-hop, heterogeneous queries to explore complex relationships between genes, drugs, diseases, and more. BTE is developed as part of the NCATS [Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/research/research-activities/translator) consortium.

  description: Although there are many databases of *drug indications*, DrugMechDB is the only database that focuses on *drug mechanisms of action*. These mechanisms of action are expressed as paths through a biomedical knowledge graph. This resource has been used to train and validate algorithms for drug repurposing.
