Alan is a Research Software Engineer in the Su Lab working on the EveryCure/Matrix project. He previously studied Pharmacology and Neuroscience in the Richardson Lab at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, where he performed patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry to investigate the role of Shank3 in regulating NMDA receptor subunits in cerebellar granule cells in developing mouse models of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Additionally, Alan utilized operant behavior techniques to examine the impact of Shank3 loss on auditory stimulus discrimination.

Alan is passionate about leveraging computational methods to accelerate pharmacology and biomedical research. He has a particular interest in behavioral neuroscience and finding innovative ways to use drugs to treat mental health disorders while contributing to the broader field of drug repurposing to improve patient lives.
