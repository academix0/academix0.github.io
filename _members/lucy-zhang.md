My name is Bailin Zhang, go by Lucy. I majored in cellular, molecular and developmental biology and did research on protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia during my undergraduate study at University of Washington in Seattle. I was lucky to find my true passion lies in host-pathogen interaction during my lab technician at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. I adapted a tool called Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) to identify the epitopes of Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) on the surface of Trypanosoma brucei using infected mouse and human antibodies. I learned python and R to design the PhIP-Seq phage library and perform data analysis, respectively. I then found I became very enthusiastic and passionate about programming. I feel accomplished when I made a simple python function or figured out a bug. I felt satisfied when I looked at my R plots. I want to learn more about bioinformatics and more about API, so that I could investigate diseases caused microbes (bacteria, parasites, viruses) with my own API translator. Outside the lab, I am a foodie! I love to try out innovative foods from different restaurants. Science and foods are the two indispensable components in my life!
