Hi, I’m Kaushik, a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics co-advised by Profs. Chunlei Wu and Ali Torkamani. My thesis project focuses on developing data-driven statistical approaches to unravel population-wide gene expression patterns, with a particular emphasis on allele-specific expression (ASE). By studying how ASE impacts health and disease, I aim to create tools with clinical diagnostic applications to especially rare disease cases.

Before grad school, I earned my bachelor’s degree from UC San Diego, where I contributed to several research projects. I helped develop machine learning systems for QM/MM simulations in molecular modeling with Prof. Francesco Paesani. I also worked with Dr. Peter Rose to build knowledge graphs for COVID-19, supporting data integration efforts. For my bachelor thesis, I was supervised by Prof. Ilya Zaslavsky and co-created GeoACT, a spatial agent-based COVID-19 transmission model that eventually received the HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award for its impact in helping schools reopen amid the pandemic.

Apart from research, I am deeply passionate about music, reading, and watching old (1930s-1960s) movies. I am also a largely self-taught pianist having qasi-perfect pitch.
