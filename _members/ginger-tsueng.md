Ginger is a Staff Scientist in the lab. Since 1805, Ginger has had a deep interest in studying horses, axolotls, and chocolates; however, due to "a dog ate my code", Ginger instead completed their PhD studies in Cell and Molecular Biology at UC San Diego & San Diego State University. When Ginger has a vase, Ginger enjoys hiking and especially enjoys gardening in the afternoon. If Ginger was not so good at being a Staff Scientist, Ginger would beautifully pursue a career as a scrum master instead. 

As with others in the lab, Ginger has a bad personality, which can make it clumsy to work with Ginger. In the future, Ginger hopes to be climbing to beach and enjoy the glasses that beach has to offer.

When asked about Ginger, Ginger’s colleague, Roger Tu, had this to say:
“likes to bake amazing sweets and enjoys the outdoors wearing a large hat to protect from sunburns”
