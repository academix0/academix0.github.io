Andrew Su, Ph.D., is the Elden and Verna Strahm Professor at the Scripps Research Institute in the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology (ISCB). Dr. Su earned his PhD in chemistry at Scripps Research in 2002, and was the Associate Director of Bioinformatics at The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) before returning to Scripps Research as a faculty member in 2011.

The Su lab focuses on building and applying bioinformatics infrastructure for biomedical discovery. Dr. Su has had a long-standing interest in leveraging crowdsourcing to organize and integrate knowledge though projects like the Gene Wiki and Wikidata. In partnership with Chunlei Wuâ€™s lab, he has also worked extensively on creating biomedical APIs and enabling API interoperability through the BioThings project. Most recently, his lab has a particular emphasis on constructing and mining knowledge graphs for drug repurposing. In all this work, the Su lab has embraced the principles of open science, open data, and open source software.

Andrew received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from The Scripps Research Institute, and BA degrees in Chemistry, Computing and Information Systems, and Integrated Science from Northwestern University.
