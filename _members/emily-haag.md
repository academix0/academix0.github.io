I grew up in the northwoods of Minnesota, but moved to Australia for college where I studied science communication, science education, and physics. I've spent the last few years in Los Angeles, working in healthcare communication industry. In my free time, I enjoy running marathons & ultras, swimming, diving, skiing, and coaching for Students Run LA.

### Education
The Australian National University and The University of Canberra
