Roger Tu, Ph.D., recently earned his PhD in Bioinformatics at Scripps Research in 2024 studying under the guidance of Professor Andrew Su. Roger joined the Su Lab as a graduate student in February 2019. Prior to Scripps, he was a Research Associate at Seattle Genetics helping to cure cancer by optimizing and developing bioprocesses for antibody production. Before that, he was an undergraduate researcher at UC Irvine trying to align heart cells on shrinky-dinks. Roger has a diverse research background spanning bioinformatics, bioprocessing, bioengineering, and material sciences. In the Su Lab, Roger is studying the application of knowledge graph completion methods on biomedical knowledge graphs for drug repurposing, and has previously worked on the Wikidata project as well as other bioinformatics/genetics projects. In his spare time, Roger likes to hike, run and eat food.
